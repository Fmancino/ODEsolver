Library for solving differential equations of the type dy/dt=f(y,t). It can handle non-\/linear differential equation of first order. ~\newline
 It has three different ways of inputting the righandside function f(y,t), which are all implemented as subclasses of the abstract class \char`\"{}righthandside\char`\"{}\+:

1)As a pointer to a Generic User defined function, though the use of the \char`\"{}\+Generic\+Function\char`\"{} class. The user can specify f(y,t) and its gradient. ~\newline
 2)As a generic polynomial function of maximum grade 4, with the use of \char`\"{}\+Polynomial\char`\"{} class. The function must be of the form\+: a+b$\ast$y+c$\ast$y$^\wedge$2+d$\ast$y$^\wedge$3+e$\ast$y$^\wedge$4 ~\newline
 3)As a function including a sine and a cosine of the form\+: a$\ast$sin(c$\ast$y)+b$\ast$cos(d$\ast$y). This is done with the \char`\"{}\+Sin\+Cos\char`\"{} class. ~\newline


Six different solvers can be used, all programmed as derived classes from the \char`\"{}\+Abstract\+Ode\+Solver\char`\"{} class\+:

1)\char`\"{}\+Forward\+Euler\+Solver\char`\"{}\+: Solves the differential equation using forward Euler method ~\newline
 2)\char`\"{}\+Backward\+Euler\+Solver\char`\"{}\+: Solves the differential equation using backward Euler method ~\newline
 3)\char`\"{}\+Twostep\+Solver\char`\"{}\+: Solves the differential equation using two step Adam Bashforth method ~\newline
 4)\char`\"{}\+Threestep\+Solver\char`\"{}\+: Solves the differential equation using three step Adam Bashforth method ~\newline
 5)\char`\"{}\+Fourstep\+Solver\char`\"{}\+: Solves the differential equation using four step Adam Bashforth method ~\newline
 6)\char`\"{}\+Runge\+Kutta4\+Solver\char`\"{}\+: Solves the differential equation using fourth order Runge-\/\+Kutta method ~\newline


The library was developed by Francesco Mancino as a project for the course \char`\"{}\+Programming concepts in scientific computing\char`\"{} at E\+P\+F\+L.
